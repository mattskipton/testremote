# About ATC Labdocs

## Purpose

The goal of ATC Labdocs is to provide a simple method for lab creators to build documentation that follows a consistent look and feel and interactive features.

We want to provide a tool that is easy for someone not familiar with documentation while still providing more advanced features.

The system uses a combination of Markdown (plain text files ending in .md), some added markdown syntax, and optional html code to reach this goal.

The documentation you are reading can be modified to create your final documentation.

## Guides and examples
A guide and examples can be found at <https://labdocs.apps.wwtatc.com/labdocs-docs>

## Basic Workflow

A common, high-level, workflow would follow:

1. Create a lab at <https://admin.wwt.com>
2. Click a button to create the labdocs on github.com
3. Edit the documentation file directly on github.com or by cloning it to your laptop and using any text editor
4. saving the changes to github.com
5. The system will automatically build your documentation and make it available
